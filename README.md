NSM Morphine theme addon for EE 2.0
===================================

This theme addon (actually an accessory) is intended to extended the default ExpressionEngine 2.0 theme with new styles specifically for addon development.

The addon comes in two parts:

1. The accessory `/acc.nsm_morphine_theme.php` &
2. The theme files `/themes`

Installation & Activation
-------------------------

1. Download the latest tag / or master branch
2. Rename the download folder to `nsm_morphine_theme`
3. Drop in the `/system/expressionengine/thirdparty/` directory of your ExpressionEngine install
4. Copy of symlink `/themes/cp_themes/default/nsm_morphine` into `/themes/cp_themes/default/`
5. Activate the accessory for all pages and all member groups

Notes
-----

Activating the accessory won't add a new tab to the control panel footer.
